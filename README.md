# Hooli XYZ
Software Dev Project
---------------------
*About Hooli XYZ* 
---------------------
Hooli XYZ intends on creating a version control product specifically for CU students. This web application would require a colorado.edu email address to sign up and would allow students taking CSCI courses to store and collaborate their code with each other.

The main function of the application is to store code either temporarily or permanently on the cloud. The secondary function of the site is to give users a friendly UI to access a running image of the latest CU Boulder VM remotely in order to test their code. The third function of this app is to allow students to share code with each other, but only with permission from the creator.
